# 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored
at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using
pointers. In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node
contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
