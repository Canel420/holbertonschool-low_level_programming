# 0x14-bit_manipulation

Bitwise manipulation allows the programmer to work with sets of bits through
logical bitwise operations. These operations are directly supported by the
processor, which makes them fast and very efficient.

The logical bitwise operators AND, OR, XOR, and NOT can be used with a mask
to extract or manipulate specific bits.
