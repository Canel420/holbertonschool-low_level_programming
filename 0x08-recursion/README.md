Recursive functions are functions that call themselfs. The idea is
represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller problems and
add one or more base condition to stop recursion (otherwise it will
go to an infinite loop)

This type or functions are very useful to solve many mathematical problemas
such as:

*Calculating the factorial.
*Generating Fibonaccie series
*Towers of Hanoi.

This folder contains some basic recursion examples.
