This folder contains introductory examples to Dynamic Memory Allocation in
C. Which is  a process where the size of a data structure (array)
is changed during runtime.

Here, i implemented only the uses for malloc and free functions. C provides more
functions for this process (calloc and relloc).

Malloc (Memory Allocation) function is used to dynamically allocate
a SINGLE large block of memory with specified size.
It returns a pointer of type void which can be cast into a pointer of any
form.
